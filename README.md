# osu!automapper


Automatic osu! beatmap generation given an offset, bpm, and difficulty.

Options for Overall Difficulty (OD), HP Drain Rate (HP), Approach Rate (AR), and Circle Size (CS).

Reach: Maps built specifically for Double Time (DT) and Hard Rock (HR)?

Will add more later.

<b>Unmaintained</b>: For some reason, using this application triggers osu!'s Anitcheat, and has caused myself to be banned. If you still would like to use/work on this project, please go offline first.
